<ColorText color="#073763">Introduction</ColorText>


<ColorText color="#000000">In this lab, a behavioral analysis of a communications network is performed using OMNeT++, a modular and extensible simulation environment designed for the study of computer networks and distributed systems.</ColorText>


The main objective of this report is to evaluate network performance under specific traffic and configuration conditions, paying special attention to key metrics such as buffer size, transmission delays, and the dynamic behavior of the system under the generated load. To this end, a simple network model composed of transmitting nodes, routing queues, and receiving nodes was designed, in which packet sending, receiving, and accumulation events are simulated over a defined time interval.

<ColorText color="#000000">Through analysis of the data obtained, relevant statistics were generated that allow for interpreting network performance based on the configured parameters.</ColorText>

<ColorText color="#073763">OMNet++</ColorText><ColorText color="#000000"> </ColorText>


<ColorText color="#000000"></ColorText>


<ColorText color="#000000">The technical and pedagogical features of OMNet++ make it an ideal platform for the analysis and modeling of communication networks.</ColorText>


<ColorText color="#000000">One of its main advantages is its discrete-event-oriented approach, which makes it especially suitable for representing the temporal behavior of networks, where actions occur sequentially and time-dependently. This allows for the accurate simulation of phenomena such as traffic accumulation, buffer overflows, and packet delivery delays, which are key aspects of this analysis.</ColorText>


<ColorText color="#000000">It also provides integrated tools for collecting, visualizing, and analyzing results, such as .vec and .sca files, which facilitate obtaining accurate and reproducible metrics.</ColorText>
